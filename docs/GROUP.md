# Group collaboration

This document describes how the group worked together and the group collaboration in general.

The group collaboration throughout the assignment was good, and the group faced no big issues when
working on the assignment.

The group started by discussing what extra feature they should implement, and after making some
light wireframes they were able to come to an agreement. After that the group started implemeting
the feature in code right away. The group did not really delegate work, but rather coded together
on one computer through active discussion. We still delegated commits though, to show that both
group members contributed in the assignment.
